{
	/// <summary>
	///     Represents the "No Equipment Durability Loss" feature in the game, which prevents the
	///     durability loss of equipment, effectively making all equipment indestructible.
	///     This feature disables the reduction in durability for all equipment items, ensuring that
	///     equipment remains in perfect condition regardless of usage or damage taken.
	///     The class manages the following functionalities:
	///     <list type="bullet">
	///         <item>
	///             <description>
	///                 Configuration of the feature's enabled state to determine whether the durability loss
	///                 prevention should be active (<see cref="IFeature.IsEnabled" />).
	///             </description>
	///         </item>
	///         <item>
	///             <description>
	///                 Integration with the <see cref="NoEquipmentDurabilityLossSystem" /> to handle the prevention
	///                 of equipment durability loss in the game's simulation.
	///             </description>
	///         </item>
	///     </list>
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	///     This class extends the <see cref="FeatureBase{TFeature}" /> base class to inherit common feature behavior,
	///     including singleton instantiation, configuration management, and execution control.
	///     The actual logic for preventing equipment durability loss is managed by the
	///     <see cref="NoEquipmentDurabilityLossSystem" />.
