I wanted a quick summon feature that allows fast summoning and then automatically swaps back to the weapon.  thanks to CK-QOL i can do this :}



Files can be placed manually in the game folder to load, or downloaded with the in-game mod manager, then found and overwritten,  

placed manually 
 Core Keeper\CoreKeeper_Data\StreamingAssets\Mods\CK-QOL

in-game mod manager location
 C:\Users\Public\mod.io\5289\mods\  then some numbers like 4315799_5560347  then you will see CK-QOL items
